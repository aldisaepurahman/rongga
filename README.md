This application is designed with the aim of assisting counseling teachers at a Junior High School under study in grouping student groups with student learning styles and the help of the average final grades of students in the previous semester. There is no special algorithm in this application, only basic algorithms such as grouping and equalising the average final grade of each student so that each student group has a balance of academic abilities, and creating differentiated learning in the classroom.

The application succeeded in achieving a score of 79.57% in terms of feasibility using the system usability scale test, but there needs to be an improvement so that the final results of the feasibility are even better. The obstacle of testing this application is the adaptation of users who are less long so that there needs to be guidance in using this application. In addition, respondents from testing this application have difficulty thinking systematically when using the application, so it is necessary to train or provide a more detailed user guide.
